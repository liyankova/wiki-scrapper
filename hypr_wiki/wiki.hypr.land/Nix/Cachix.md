# Cachix – Hyprland Wiki

# Cachix

Note

This page only applies to the flake package.  
You can safely skip this if you use the Nixpkgs package.

The Hyprland flake is not built by Hydra, so it is not cached in
[cache.nixos.org](https://cache.nixos.org), like the rest of Nixpkgs.

Instead of requiring you to build Hyprland (and its dependencies, which may
include `mesa`, `ffmpeg`, etc), we provide a Cachix cache that you can add to
your Nix configuration.

The [Hyprland Cachix](https://app.cachix.org/cache/hyprland) exists to cache the
`hyprland` packages and any dependencies not found in [cache.nixos.org](https://cache.nixos.org).

Warning

In order for Nix to take advantage of the cache, it has to be enabled **before**
using the Hyprland flake package.

configuration.nix

```
{
  nix.settings = {
    substituters = ["https://hyprland.cachix.org"];
    trusted-substituters = ["https://hyprland.cachix.org"];
    trusted-public-keys = ["hyprland.cachix.org-1:a7pgxzMz7+chwVL3/pzj6jIBMioiJM7ypFP8PwtkuGc="];
  };
}
```

Warning

Do **not** override Hyprland’s `nixpkgs` input
unless you know what you are doing.  
Doing so will render the cache useless, since you’re building from a different
Nixpkgs commit.
