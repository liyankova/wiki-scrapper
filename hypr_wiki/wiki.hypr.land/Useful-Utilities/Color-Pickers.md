# Color pickers

Color pickers are useful for quickly grabbing a color of *something* on your
screen.

It’s preferred using *hyprwm*’s own solution, which, so far, seems to be the
only one that doesn’t suck.

## Hyprpicker

Dead simple to use. Launch, click, and you’re done. Also see
[its wiki page](../../Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpicker).
